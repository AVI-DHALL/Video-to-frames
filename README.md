# Video-to-frames
A PHP project where a user will upload a video and get the frames at a specific frames per second (fps). This project aims to perform many operations like merging all the frames (achieved), comparing the changes in the frames with respect to a particular frame (achieved), and many more.

Build with the help of following:
1. PHP
2. HTML
3. CSS
4. Javascript
5. GD Graphics Library of PHP
6. ffmpeg.exe => https://ffmpeg.org (FFmpeg is a free software project that produces libraries and programs for handling multimedia data.)
7. Bootstrap => https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-business-casual/tree/gh-pages

For better undertanding of how the folders and files of this project are interconnected, do have a look at the video uploaded by me.
